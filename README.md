resources

Provide an extremely lightweight REST endpoint manager.

Quick Start:

-MyContainer extends Container
-MyModule extends Module
-MyResource extends Resource

Resource follows jersey protocols.
Container serves as the endpoint to each resource.
Module is used to connect all the pieces together
